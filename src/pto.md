# 🧠 TokenWise — Real-Time Wallet Intelligence on Solana

## 🔍 Project Overview

**TokenWise** is a real-time intelligence tool designed to monitor and analyze wallet behavior for specific tokens on the **Solana blockchain**. Your goal is to build a system that tracks the **top 60 token holders**, captures their transaction activity in real time, and visualizes market trends through a clean dashboard.

> 💡 Target Token:
> 
> 
> Contract Address: `9BB6NFEcjBCtnNLFko2FqVQBq8HHM13kCyYcdQbgpump` (Solana)
>

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🧾 **Discover** the top 60 wallets holding a specific Solana token
- 🔄 **Real-time monitoring** of token-related transactions (buys/sells)
- 🛠️ **Identify** protocols used (e.g., Jupiter, Raydium, Orca)
- 📈 **Generate insights dashboard** for market trend analysis
- 🕰️ **Support historical analysis** with custom time filters

## 💻 Technical Requirements

### 1. Top Wallet Discovery

- Connect to Solana via RPC
- Fetch and display top 60 wallet addresses holding the token
- Store balance, wallet address, and token quantity

### 2. Real-Time Transaction Monitoring

- Track token buys and sells by these wallets in real time
- Capture:
    - Timestamps
    - Amounts
    - Buy/Sell indicator
    - Protocol used (Jupiter, Raydium, Orca)
    - Wallet address

### 3. Insights Dashboard

- Create a simple dashboard (can be local or web) that shows:
    - Total number of buys vs sells
    - Net direction (buy-heavy, sell-heavy)
    - Wallets with repeated activity
    - Protocol usage breakdown

### 4. Historical Analysis

- Enable querying of past activity with time filters
- Exportable reports (CSV/JSON) with transaction summaries
